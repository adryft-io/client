    <h3>About us</h3>

      <p>
        The internet of things (IoT) is a network of
        physical objects, embedded with software, sensors, actuators and
        most importantly, network connectivity. <b>New reactions</b>  is a
        way to interact with technology that
        surrounds our physical and digital space.
        We believe in the power of distance and
        detachment, where someone can control
        a certain aspect of their lives, without being
        attached to it.  This project was born out of admiration of <b>IFTTTâ€™s</b>  brilliant
        approach to automation -- paying homage while innovating on the concept. Here, we harness
        the power of technology to transform
        actions into reactions.
