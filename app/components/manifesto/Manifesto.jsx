        We are committed to the internet of things because
        we believe in the future of technology.
        At this point in history humans have become incredibly
        good at sharing, storing and retrieving information. Now
        it is time to turn information into action, where
        technologies start to detect and communicate information
        wirelessly in order to provoke reaction.
        Consider the collapse of a bridge in Minnesota back in 2007
        which costed the deaths of many people. Now we can
        rebuild it with smart cement: cement equipped with sensors that can monitor stresses,
        cracks and warpages. It can also alert if there
        is ice on the bridge, or if there is a structural
        problem that could be a hazard for potential users.

        This cement would communicate wirelessly with your
        car which in turn would alert the driver that
        there is a hazard ahead. The way IoT transitions
        information to action is a fundamental shift in
        the way technology impacts our lives. When we
        start making smart objects that can gather
        information and turn it into action, we can now
        have a major engine for creating new products and services.
        The internet of things is the next step on the technological ladder.
