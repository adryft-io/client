New reactions is a platform to interact with technology that surrounds our physical and digital space. We believe in the power of connectivity and automation, where someone can control a certain aspect of their lives, without being attached to it. This project was born from an admiration of IFTTT’s brilliant approach to IoT -- simultaneously paying homage and innovating on the concept. Here, we harness the power of technology to transform actions into reactions.

## About Our SoA Microservices Architecture 
We believe in building software-as-a-service, with modular microservices : 

1. Declarative formats to reduce the amount of time and cost for new developers to join the project. 
2. Offer portability between execution environments. 
3. Reduce divergence between development and production which allows for continuous deployment. 
4. Finally, being able to scale up without significant changes to the tools, architecture and development practices.
