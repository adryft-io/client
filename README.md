New reactions is a way to interact with technology that surrounds our physical and digital space. We believe in the power of distance and detachment, where someone can control a certain aspect of their lives, without being attached to it. This project started as a way to emulate and reverse engineer IFTTT’s brilliant approach to IoT. Here, we harvest the power of technology to transform actions into reactions.

## A few things you need to know
Our application is quite robust. We mounted our services on Docker containers and deployed them on AWS. We also make use of AWS SQS queue service in order to integrate our application. 

## About Our SoA Architecture 
We believe in building software-as-a-service where our web apps follow a constructive methodology that uses: 

1. Declarative formats to reduce the amount of time and cost for new developers to join the project. 
2. Offer portability between execution environments. 
3. Reduce divergence between development and production which allows for continuous deployment. 
4. Finally, being able to scale up without significant changes to the tools, architecture and development practices.
