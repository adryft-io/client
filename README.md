New reactions is a platform to interact with technology that surrounds our physical and digital space. We believe in the power of connectivity and automation, where someone can control a certain aspect of their lives, without being attached to it. This project was born from an admiration of IFTTT’s brilliant approach to IoT -- simultaneously paying homage and innovating on the concept. Here, we harness the power of technology to transform actions into reactions.

## Microservices Architecture 
New Reactions is a platform built upon modular microservices -- each service runs in a Docker container linked together through a docker-compose file, which offers: 

1. Portability between execution environments, such as AWS or Digital Ocean. 
2. Minimize divergence between development and production enviroments which streamlines continious deployment. 
3. Scalability --- new instances of microserices can be readily created.
